# Wix Restaurants API
The Wix Restaurants API is is the canonical way to integrate with the [Wix Restaurants](http://www.wix.com/restaurant/website) platform.

The API exposes the full functionality of the platform (there are no private APIs), and all Wix Restaurants products are developed on top of it.
